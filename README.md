Interactive Windmill and Mountain Landscape using OpenGL functions
This project demonstrates an animated windmill landscape using OpenGL with various graphical elements such as mountains, hills, and windmills. The windmills rotate continuously, and the scene transitions between day and night modes. This C program is built using OpenGL and GLUT libraries.

Features
Windmill Animation: Multiple windmills rotate around their axis in a landscape.
Day/Night Cycle: The scene transitions between day and night, changing the background and colors of the landscape accordingly. (Menu option: Right click to change between day and night)
Mountain and Hill Drawing: The landscape includes mountains and hills with customizable colors and shapes.
Realistic Shadows: Windmill shadows appear during the day for a more realistic effect.
